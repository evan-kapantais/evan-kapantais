### Hi there 👋

👋 I'm a web developer based somewhere inbetween Athens and Barcelona.
💻 I primarily work with JS, React, Gatsby, Contentful, Strapi and MongoDB.
🎮 I am a sound designer by trade and an avid gamer on PC and PS4.
🛹 Besides computers, I enjoy skateboarding, hiking, exploring rural Greece and reading non-fiction.
🐈 There's no such thing as "too many cats".
