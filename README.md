👋 I'm a web developer based somewhere inbetween Athens and Barcelona.

💻 I primarily work with React, Gatsby, Contentful, Strapi, MongoDB and Express.

🎮 I am a sound designer by trade and a lifelong gamer on PC and PS4.

🛹 Besides computers, I enjoy skateboarding, hiking, exploring rural Greece and reading non-fiction.

🐈 There's no such thing as "too many cats".
